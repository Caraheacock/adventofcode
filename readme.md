# Advent of Code Solutions in Ruby (◡‿◡✿)

Here are my solutions for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com)'s problems, in Ruby.

Advent of Code is a really cool series of coding word problems, all of them Christmas-themed. There will be 25 total, and a new one comes out every day, like an advent calendar. I think it's pretty awesome.

I'm keeping this code pretty minimalist, with the exception of comments explaining what all the parts are doing. I'm not going to reiterate the problems, so look at this code in the context of the word problem.

My inputs are in the "inputs" directory, and I made a custom method in utility.rb that just reads and returns the contents. If a particular day had a really short input, I just included it directly in the ruby file, so there isn't an input file for every day.

### Overview

1. [Day 1](http://adventofcode.com/day/1) - stairs directions
2. [Day 2](http://adventofcode.com/day/2) - present dimensions
3. [Day 3](http://adventofcode.com/day/3) - delivery directions
4. [Day 4](http://adventofcode.com/day/4) - brute-force MD5 digest
5. [Day 5](http://adventofcode.com/day/5) - naughty and nice word list
6. [Day 6](http://adventofcode.com/day/6) - light grids
7. [Day 7](http://adventofcode.com/day/7) - bitwise logic
8. [Day 8](http://adventofcode.com/day/8) - parsing character length
9. [Day 9](http://adventofcode.com/day/9) - delivery routes between cities
10. [Day 10](http://adventofcode.com/day/10) - look and say
11. [Day 11](http://adventofcode.com/day/11) - password generator
12. [Day 12](http://adventofcode.com/day/12) - accounting system

### Directions

1. Clone/fork this repo.
2. Navigate into the directory via terminal.
3. Run the code like you would run any vanilla Ruby files.

Example:
```
$ ruby advent01.rb
=> Santa ended on floor 232
=> Santa first reached the basement at step 1783
```

### Why Make a Repo

I was contemplating sharing my solutions for the first couple days, thinking that it would be fun to show them and potentially help others who are stuck and get feedback on what others think of my code. Then it became a necessity because I did days 1 and 2 on my work computer and day 3 on my personal computer and I'm a completionist and wanted to have them all together and be able to work on them from any of my computers. Thus, a repo was born.

### About Me

I'm [Cara](http://caraheacock.com), and I'm a full-stack developer at [Big Wheel Brigade](http://bigwheelbrigade.com). Most of the applications we create are Ruby on Rails, and some WordPress sites here and there.

I went to [Omaha Code School](http://omahacodeschool.com) in early 2014 which is where I learned how to web. We were primarily taught Ruby, Rails, and the mandatory front-end languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). After I graduated I promptly dropped Ruby/Rails for the longest time and was creating a lot of WordPress sites at my next places of employment, until I ended up at Big Wheel. Now I'm back in Ruby land, and after having been immersed in PHP for so long, I really, *really* missed Ruby and didn't even realize it until I got back into it.

Yay, Ruby ✧･ﾟ:*╰(◕‿◕｡╰) So great
